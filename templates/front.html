        <h3>We're all characters, here</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Characters @ OpenFurry!  This is the place to keep character descriptions and reference images - if you need to show an artist, simply link them to the character, a morph of that character, or a specific description pertaining to that morph.  You can associate images (following a by-me/for-me policy similar to FurAffinity's) with your characters, morphs, and descriptions.</p>
        <p>Characters is a work in progress, so look forward to also having the ability to store RP logs associated with one or more characters, per-user permissions (whitelist or blacklist), and a snazzy new interface!</p>
